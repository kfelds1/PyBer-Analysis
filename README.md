# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Using different Python modules such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy, I generated summary statistics and visual figures to analyze ridesharing data in different city types to see the limiting factors in accessibility to these services.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to further break down the number of drivers, number of rides, and the fare amount for the rides through three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban. In this challenge, I specifically calculated the total rides, total drivers, and total fares to determine the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. Then, I created a figure to display the total weekly fares, separated by city type. With these important pieces of data and visualizations, I could clearly see the discrepancy of statistics between ride sharing services and city type.

## Results

As seen from the table below there is quite a difference in data between rural, suburban, and urban areas regarding ridesharing services. Urban regions have both the highest number of riders and drivers, and rural regions have the lowest number of riders and drivers, with suburban regions being in the middle. This makes sense, as urban areas are the most populated and they will be having more people in need for rides, driving up the demand for drivers. The opposite is true for the lesser populated areas, suburban and rural regions. Since there are more drivers in the urban areas, the driver will receive less for each ride because they are competing with other drivers. The opposite is true for the lesser populated regions. The data follows the simple law of supply and demand.

The below figure shows the total fares for the first several months of 2019 for each of the three city types. Though the fare amount stays relatively constant through the months, there is a general peak for all three types in the last week of February. This might be the result of an increase in the demand for drivers. If we explored a figure that showed the total weekly fares for the next few months, there would likely be a trend of increasing total fares due to the warmer weather.

## Summary

Though it makes sense for sparsley populated areas to have less drivers and thus a more expensive ride fare and vice versa, that does not mean that those who live in rural regions should have to pay significantly more for a ride. One idea that ridesharing services can implement to lessen the ride fare gap among those living in different city types could be to provide a stipend to drivers who service those in urban areas to incentivize them to take time to travel to rural areas and service those people.

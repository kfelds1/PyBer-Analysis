# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Using different Python modules such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy, I generated summary statistics and visual figures to analyze ridesharing data in different city types to see the limiting factors in accessibility to these services.

## Purpose

The purpose of this PyBer analysis was to further break down the number of drivers, number of rides, and the fare amount for the rides through three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban. In this challenge, I specifically calculated the total rides, total drivers, and total fares to determine the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. Then, I created a figure to display the total weekly fares, separated by city type. With these important pieces of data and visualizations, I could clearly see the discrepancy of statistics between ridesharing services and city type.

## Results

As seen from the table below there is quite a difference in data between rural, suburban, and urban areas regarding ridesharing services. Urban regions have both the highest number of riders and drivers, and rural regions have the lowest number of riders and drivers, with suburban regions being in the middle. This makes sense, as urban areas are the most populated and they will be having more people in need for rides, driving up the demand for drivers. The opposite is true for the lesser populated areas, suburban and rural regions. Since there are more drivers in the urban areas, the driver will receive less for each ride because they are competing with other drivers. The opposite is true for the lesser populated regions. The data follows the simple law of supply and demand.

Another key fact that is worth pointing out is that the urban city type is the only one out of the three that has more drivers than riders. Since there is much competition between drivers, there is inevitably lower fares for the drivers.

The below figure shows the total fares for the first several months of 2019 for each of the three city types. Though the fare amount stays relatively constant through the months, there is a general peak for all three types in the last week of February. This might be the result of an increase in the demand for drivers. If we explored a figure that showed the total weekly fares for the next few months, there would likely be a trend of increasing total fares due to the warmer weather.

## Summary

Though it makes sense for sparsely populated areas to have less drivers and thus a more expensive ride fare and vice versa, that does not mean that those who live in rural regions should have to pay significantly more for a ride. Additionally, since there is a very large amount of urban drivers relative to the number of urban rides, there should be some sort of compensation for those urban drivers who are not getting paid as much as they need. There are a few ideas that the CEO of PyBer could use to address these problems:

One idea that PyBer can implement to lessen the ride fare gap among those living in different city types could be to provide a stipend to drivers who service those in urban areas to incentivize them to take time to travel to rural areas and service those people. In turn, this would also take some urban drivers, who are in need of more money, into rural areas to earn the money that they need through ridesharing.

PyBer could also expand its analysis by including more data, such as the total fares for the whole year rather than just the beginning months of the year. In this case, there might be some surprising outcomes when it comes to weekly fares for the remaining months of the year. It might also be necessary to collect data on the demographics of riders in the three city types. This way, PyBer could find ways to advertise their service in a way that would attract more business.

Finally, relating to the last point, PyBer could implement a discount program to riders who travel a certain distance. Likely those in rural areas would be riding further distances in order to get to their destination, so if there was some type of discount that would reward a certain amount of mileage achieved, this might attract more riders in the rural areas.

# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Using different Python modules such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy, I generated summary statistics and visual figures to analyze ridesharing data in different city types to see the limiting factors in accessibility to these services.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to further break down the number of drivers, number of rides, and the fare amount for the rides through three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban. In this challenge, I specifically calculated the total rides, total drivers, and total fares to determine the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. Then, I created a figure to display the total weekly fares, separated by city type. With these important pieces of data and visualizations, I could clearly see the discrepancy of statistics between ride sharing services and city type.
